;; This is really awkward, as we don't want to
;; declare an in-frame-p method for the tree-parent class,
;; as we would overshadow the implementation for the `tree-frame`
;; type, which needs to use the regular `frame` implementation:
(defmethod in-frame-p ((parent output-node) x y)
  ;; output nodes have exactly 1 child:
  (let ((f (car (tree-children parent))))
    (in-frame-p f x y)))

(defmethod frame-at ((parent output-node) x y)

  (let ((f (car (tree-children parent))))
