# Features
This document describes the planned features of Mahogany. If you would like to suggest
something, please submit a pull request adding it to this document, or create a new issue.

Please include the following information:
1. Is this feature already present in Stumpwm? 
   + If so, is there anything about the functionality in Stumpwm that can be improved?
   + If not, does it replace one of StumpWM's features, or is it entirely new?
2. If it is a new or controversial feature, why should it be included?

If there is something that is included in StumpWM that has caused problems in the past, it may also be worth adding under the
[Features that shouldn't be included](#Features-that-shouldn't-be-included) section.

## Features that are in StumpWM
+ Tiling and Floating Windows
  + Automatically make some windows floating (see how i3/Sway does it)
  + Make switching between open tiled windows and floating windows better
  + Instead of the frame tree being binary, allow for some frames to have more than 2 children
+ Command system for implementing keybindings
+ Keyboard driven window management
+ Input focus
  - Can options for`*mouse-focus-policy*` be improved? Should all existing options be implemented?
    Should new options be added?

## New Features
+ Default to a more usable/beginner friendly initial configuration

## Features that shouldn't be included
+ User interaction features like menus, messages, and input boxes should be implemented as separate applications,
  or already existing applications should be used.
