* Frames
** Focusing
   + A frame holds focus, not the window that is inside of it.
** Depth
  Frames have depth. This dictates which frames are shown overtop of
  one another. This depth is mainly used to layer floating windows and
  to make them feel more like a pile of papers on a desk, but tiling
  frames have this feature as well.
  + The layer closest to the user is 0, followed by layer 1.
  + Each time a frame is focused, its depth resets to zero. If a frame
  is focused that overlays another frame, those frames drop down a
  level. This is a recursive process, as frames that drop in level
  also need to check if they overlap any frames and lower their level
  as well.
** Frame types
*** Frames
*** Floating Frames
    + These frames have absoulte XY positioning. These are the type of
    frames present in ~frame-list~.
*** Tree-frames
    + The tree-frame is a tree of frames. Tree-frames represent the
    internal nodes in the tree.
*** Leaf-frames
    + Leaf frames in the tree that actually hold windows

*** Child frames?
