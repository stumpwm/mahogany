#+TITLE: Default Applications

Mahogany assumes several applications are installed by default. This
is a guide on how to customize those applications.

** Terminal Emulator

Mahogany has a function called =open-terminal= that opens a terminal
emulator. It goes through a list of common terminal apps and tries
to open them in order:
1. alacritty
2. ghostty
3. kitty
4. xfce4-terminal
5. konsole
6. gnome-terminal
7. wezterm
8. foot

You can customize this list by modifying the =*default-terminals*=
variable.
