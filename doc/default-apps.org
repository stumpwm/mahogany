#+TITLE: Default Applications

Mahogany assumes several applications are installed by default. This
is a guide on how to customize those applications.

** Terminal Emulator

Mahogany has a function called =open-terminal= that opens a terminal
emulator. It uses the following scheme to find the right one to open:
1. Examines the =$TERMINAL= environment variable. If it has a value
   and a corresponding executable on =$PATH=, it uses that
   application.
2. Goes through the following list of common terminal apps and tries
   to open them in order:
   1. konsole
   2. gnome-terminal
   3. wezterm
   4. foot
