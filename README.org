* Mahogany
  Mahogany is a tiling window manager for Wayland modeled after
  StumpWM. While it is not a drop-in replacement for stumpwm, stumpwm
  users should be very comfortable with Mahogany. Its planned
  features are:
  + Easy extensibility: through the use of different modes, users can
    modify keybindings present in Mahogany.
  + Module system that allows users to load and use code at their
    discretion.
  + Programs to interact with other running services such as
    pulseaudio and alsamixer, as well as facilities to control screen
    brightness. These are module based, so they don't have to be
    loaded if your system doesn't use them.
  + Good support for floating windows.
  + A configuration system using Common Lisp.

  This branch contains a version of Mahogany using a backend written
  in C. The old version written entirely in Common Lisp can be found in
  the [[https://github.com/stumpwm/mahogany/tree/full-cl-old][full-cl-old]] branch.

** Contributing / Hacking

Mahogany is still in an early stage of development. See the 
[[https://github.com/stumpwm/mahogany/milestones][list of milestones]]
for features or work that is ready to be started.

You can also browse the issue list for labels marked with
[[https://github.com/stumpwm/mahogany/labels/good%20first%20issue][Good First Issue]].

Before writing code, please look at [[CONTRIBUTING.md][CONTRIBUTING.md]]

** Building
   There are two parts to Mahogany: a backend library implemented in C, and
   the Common Lisp front end. Thus, you will need the following tools:
   + A C compiler (tested with GCC and clang)
   + Steel Bank Common Lisp
   + GNU Make
   + Meson

   Several dependencies are shipped with Mahogany as git
   submodules. To download them, run the following git command:

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   git submodule update --init
   #+END_SRC

To see a full example of this process, see the 
[[https://github.com/stumpwm/mahogany/blob/master/Dockerfile][CI's Dockerfile]]

*** Backend Library Dependencies
The backend library requires wlroots 0.18.x. This
version is included as a git submodule and is used by
default. See the README in the submodule or consult
the [[https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots/-/tree/0.18.2?ref_type=tags][project's git repo]]
on how to build it.

While it is possible to use a prebuilt version of wlroots installed by
other means, it is currently not supported by directly invoking =make=
like these instructions suggest. (See [[https://github.com/stumpwm/mahogany/issues/80][#80]])

*** Common Lisp Dependencies
You will need a Common Lisp implementation. While it should run on any
version that the CFFI library supports, SBCL and CCL are supported.

The recommended way to install the dependencies is using
Quicklisp. Follow the instructions at https://www.quicklisp.org/ to
install it.

Once downloaded, install the dependencies:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (ql:quickload '("alexandria" "cl-ansi-text" "terminfo"
		  "snakes" "iterate" "cffi" "cffi-grovel" "closer-mop"))
#+END_SRC

*** Building And Running
At this point, all of the dependencies should be installed. You can
now run =make= in the root directory of the project to build the C
backend and the mahogany executable.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  make
  # if success, run the program!
  make run
  # Can also do:
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=build/lib64:build/lib ./build/mahogany
#+END_SRC

If you want to build mahogany (or execute any of the other build
commands) with CCL, you can do so by specifying CCL when invoking
make:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  make LISP=ccl
#+END_SRC

It is possible to run mahogany in an X11 or Wayland session, and is
the recommended method of testing at this time. If you do choose to
run the program in a TTY, press the =ESC= key to exit.
